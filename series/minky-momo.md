## Overview
Magical Princess Minky Momo is a 1982 anime original created by Takeshi Shudo, also famous for writing for the Pokemon anime, and Studio Ashi (Named Studio Reed since 2007). The story follows Minky Momo, the Princess of the fairytale kingdom of Fenarinarsa as she solves peoples problems and makes their dreams come true. 

Occasionally titled with the english name <a href="Media/Mahou_no_Princess_Minky_Momo_Yume_no_Naka_no_Rondo_00.07.42.278.jpg">"Fairy Princess Minky Momo"</a>, the series was followed up by an OVA, La Ronde in my Dream, set sometime between episodes 30 and 46,s and a sequel/reboot series, <a href="/series/minky-momo-1991/">Magical Princess Minky Momo Hold on to Your Dreams in 1991</a> that often calls back to and refers to this series, but has a different Momo main character, this time from the Kingdom of Marinasa. That series and it's spinoffs are categorised seperately on this website, but the two articles will occasionally cross reference each other.

Minky Momo is primarily set in Some Town, Some Country. Vaguelly european in setting, but also with some japanese elements.
