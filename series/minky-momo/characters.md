    <h3>Voiced by : Mami Koyama (小山茉美)</h3>

    By saying the magic words, she transforms into her adult alter-ego and gains the skills and outfit of a profession she chooses to fit the problem of the week, if there's a fire she becomes a firefighter, a race means becoming a race driver, a football player. 
    It's demonstrated on several occasions that she retains her gained skills and knowledge after reverting to her child form, but staying as an adult is useful for being less conspicuous or better inhabiting a role. 

    She is accompanied on her adventures with her pets, Sindbook the Dog, Mocha the Monkey and Pipiru the Bird.
