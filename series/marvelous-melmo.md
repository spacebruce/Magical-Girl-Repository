## Plot and Themes
## Opening titles and branding
Melmo was re-ran on television in 1998 with a new opening title sequence. The song is the same, but recomposed and sung in a more contemporary style, ditching the "childrens quoir" used in many Tezuka anime. This version was titled <ruby>Marvelous Melmo Renewal<rt>ふしぎなメルモ リニューアル</rt></ruby>. Besides the change in opening titles, I'm unaware of any other changes to the content of the episodes. 

I've included the 1972 version for viewing and download here as finding it isn't the easiest nowadays, I will replace it with a higher quality version if I ever find one.
